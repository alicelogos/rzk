# Yoneda lemma for ∞-categories

This is a formalization library for simplicial Homotopy Type Theory (sHoTT) with
the aim of proving the Yoneda lemma for ∞-categories following the paper
"[A type theory for synthetic ∞-categories](https://higher-structures.math.cas.cz/api/files/issues/Vol1Iss1/RiehlShulman)"
[^1]. This formalization project could be regarded as a companion to the article
"[Could ∞-category theory be taught to undergraduates?](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202305/noti2692/noti2692.html)"
[^2].

Formalizations were contributed by [Fredrik Bakke](https://github.com/fredrik-bakke),
[Nikolai Kudasov](https://fizruk.github.io/),
[Emily Riehl](https://emilyriehl.github.io/), and
[Jonathan Weinberger](https://sites.google.com/view/jonathanweinberger).
