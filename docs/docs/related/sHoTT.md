# sHoTT

<a href="https://github.com/fizruk/sHoTT" target="_blank">sHoTT</a> is a formalisation project for simplicial HoTT and ∞-categories.

The project is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/emilyriehl/yoneda" target="_blank">https://github.com/emilyriehl/yoneda</a>,
with a goal to grow and eventually include various
formalisations for HoTT (e.g. HoTT book),
synthetic fibered ∞-categories from the work of Ulrik Buchholtz and Jonathan Weinberger, variations of cubical type theories, etc.

See more details in the documentation of the project at
