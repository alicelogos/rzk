# sHoTT

[sHoTT](https://github.com/fizruk/sHoTT) is a formalisation project for simplicial HoTT and ∞-categories.

The project is a fork of https://github.com/emilyriehl/yoneda,
with a goal to grow and eventually include various
formalisations for HoTT (e.g. HoTT book),
synthetic fibered ∞-categories from the work of Ulrich Buchholtz and Jonathan Weinberger, variations of cubical type theories, etc.

See more details in the documentation of the project at
[https://github.com/fizruk/sHoTT](https://github.com/fizruk/sHoTT).
