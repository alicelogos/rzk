# We have a blog now!

This weekend I have spent some time to make some updates to the Rzk website.
In particular, we now have multi-lingual support (with some significant portions translated to Russian)
as well as a blog system, where we plan to regularly post about changes and improvements
to Rzk, tooling, and related formalization projects.
