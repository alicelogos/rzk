# simple-topes

<a href="https://github.com/fizruk/simple-topes" target="_blank">simple-topes</a> is a playground theorem prover project for type theory with shapes that allows user-defined cubes and topes. Once stable, the project will be merged into `rzk`, extending it to a proof assistant for type theory with (user-defined) cubes, topes, and shapes.
